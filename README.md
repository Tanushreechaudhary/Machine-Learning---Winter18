# Why are our best and most experienced employees leaving prematurely?
HR Analytics using Machine Learning Models

#### Technologies: ML Models, ScikitLearn, numpy, Python, Tableau

* Applied Logistic Regression, LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis), Random Forest, Gradient Boosting to IBM Employee data set to predict employee attrition based on predictor variables like Job Satisfaction, Monthly Income, Marital Status, Years at the current role and company etc. 
* Performed Feature Ranking to improve Random Forest and Gradient boost (as they had higher accuracy compared to Logistic Regression and LDA)
* Recommended to use Gradient boosting which had an accuracy of 87% and helps control variance and bias.
